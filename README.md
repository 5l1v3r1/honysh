# honysh

A utility to tile MacOS terminal from itself to right or left written in Go and C (using deprecated Apple Framework: Carbon).

I made this to get possibility to do on-demand optional tiling only on terminal without yabai.

If I have motivation and time I'll probably improve it in the next weeks :)

## Installation

`make install`

## Usage:

`honysh left` will move the terminal to the left part of the display

`honysh right` will move the terminal to the right part of the display
